## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting AlphaFold2**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | What It Means | What To Do |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **504 Gateway Timeout** | Server overloaded | ✅ App automatically tries next format |
| **"All payload formats failed"** | All attempts failed | 💡 Try again in 5-10 minutes |
| **Long processing time** | Normal for AlphaFold2 | ⏳ Wait up to 30 minutes |
| **"Request queued"** | In server queue | 📍 Your position is being tracked |

### **Quick Fixes**

1. **If AlphaFold2 fails**:
   ```
   ✅ Switch to "OpenFold2" (usually faster)
   ✅ Try again in 5-10 minutes
   ✅ Use Demo Mode to test the interface
   ✅ Try a shorter sequence (< 200 amino acids)
   ```

2. **If you're in a hurry**:
   ```
   ⚡ Use "OpenFold2" - typically 2-5 minutes
   🎮 Use "Demo Mode" for instant results
   🧪 Try with a shorter test sequence first
   ```

## 📊 **Expected Performance**

| Model | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **AlphaFold2** | 🐌 5-10 min | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highest quality |
| **OpenFold2** | ⚡ 2-5 min | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good balance |
| **AlphaFold2 Multimer** | 🐌 7-15 min | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Protein complexes |
| **Boltz2** | 🚀 3-7 min | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Latest features |

## 🎯 **Testing Your Setup**

### **Quick Test with AlphaFold2**:

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:8502
2. **Select**: "AlphaFold2" from dropdown
3. **Sequence**: Use "Insulin B-chain (30 AA)" example
4. **Click**: "Predict Structure"
5. **Wait**: Should complete in 5-10 minutes
6. **Result**: 3D structure with high confidence

### **If AlphaFold2 is too slow**:

1. **Select**: "OpenFold2" instead
2. **Same sequence**: Insulin B-chain
3. **Click**: "Predict Structure"  
4. **Wait**: Should complete in 2-5 minutes
5. **Result**: Good quality 3D structure

## 🎉 **What's Fixed**

Your original issues:
> "✅ Valid protein sequence with 30 amino acids
> Predicting structure using AlphaFold2...
> Trying payload format 1... failed
> Payload format 2 failed with status 504"

**NOW FIXED**:
- ✅ **504 errors handled gracefully**
- ✅ **Extended timeout (30 minutes for AlphaFold2)**
- ✅ **Better user feedback**
- ✅ **Smart payload format retries**
- ✅ **Clear progress indication**
- ✅ **Helpful error messages with suggestions**

The app will now automatically handle 504 errors and keep trying different formats, giving AlphaFold2 enough time to complete the structure prediction! 🧬✨
