## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use both apps at the same time?**
A: Yes! They run on different ports or can be run separately.

**Q: Do they share data?**
A: No, each app has independent session state. Use export/import to share.

**Q: Which is more accurate?**
A: Same accuracy - they use the same prediction models. Workflow app adds analysis on top.

**Q: Can I convert Original App results to Workflow?**
A: Yes - download the PDB from Original App, then upload it in Workflow App as a target or binder.

**Q: Which should I use for my thesis/paper?**
A: Use Workflow App for reproducibility, documentation, and complete project export.
